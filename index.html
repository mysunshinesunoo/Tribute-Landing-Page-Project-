    <p id="img-caption"><strong>ENHYPEN</strong> is a South Korean boy band formed in 2020 through the reality show "I-Land." They debuted with "Border: Day One" EP in November 2020. The group consists of seven members: Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, and Ni-ki. Known for their dynamic performances, they've gained international popularity with hits like "Given-Taken" and "Drunk-Dazed."</p>

    <p id="tributeinfo">In March 2019, Belift Lab (Belift) was co-founded by South Korean entertainment agencies CJ E&M and Hybe Corporation, with plans to create a new band in 2020. Auditions commenced the same month in Seoul, the United States, Taiwan, and Japan, among others locations, seeking male trainees born between 1997 and 2008. On May 8, 2020, television channel Mnet announced the survival competition series I-Land as part of the joint venture between the two entertainment companies that "follows the process of next generation K-pop artists being born". Enhypen was formed through the show, which featured 23 male trainees, some of whom were originally auditioned for Belift, while others transferred from Big Hit Music. The show aired weekly on Mnet from June 26 to September 18, 2020, and internationally on Hybe Labels' YouTube channel. The series was split into two parts, with the top twelve contestants from the first part advancing to the second. On the last episode of the show, seven members were selected out of the nine final contestants, with six chosen by global rankings and one by producers' choice. The final lineup of Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-ki was announced on the live television broadcast of the finale. <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhypen" target="_blank">More...</a></p>
